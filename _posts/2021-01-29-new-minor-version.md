*New BrainFlow Version Released*

### Summary of Changes:

* Add autogenerated API reference for [Matlab](https://brainflow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/UserAPI.html#matlab-api-reference)
* Fix all compilation warnings
* Tune concentration and relaxation metrics 
* Add `insert_marker` and `get_marker_channel` methods for all supported devices
* Refactor BrainFlow boards and json file with board params

#### Markers

In this version API to insert software defined markers was added. Currently there are two methods to work with them:

* insert_marker
* get_marker_channel

**Example:**

```python
board = BoardShim(board_id, params)
board.prepare_session()
board.start_stream()

for i in range(10):
    time.sleep(1)
    board.insert_marker(i + 1)

data = board.get_board_data()
board.stop_stream()
board.release_session()
``` 

You can use any double value as a marker except zero which is a default.

To get markers you can write:


```python
marker_channel = BoardShim.get_marker_channel(board_id)
marker_data = data[marker_channel]
```
