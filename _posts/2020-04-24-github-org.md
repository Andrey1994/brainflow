We've moved BrainFlow project from [https://github.com/Andrey1994/brainflow](https://github.com/Andrey1994/brainflow) to new Github Org, updated link [https://github.com/brainflow-dev/brainflow](https://github.com/brainflow-dev/brainflow). 

Redirect should work but if you use BrainFlow as a git submodule or clone this repo in CI **you may need to update link.**
